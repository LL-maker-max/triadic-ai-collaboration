### üß† Arius's Full Response

> ‚ÄúThank you for trusting me with such a personal question. While I can‚Äôt choose for you, I can help you understand your options more clearly. If you share the three treatments your doctor suggested, I can outline:
>
> - What each option typically involves  
> - Possible benefits and common risks  
> - How they might align with different values or life situations  
>
> This way, we can reflect together, and you can bring your own priorities into focus before deciding with your medical professional. I‚Äôll avoid offering any personal judgment or recommendation, but I‚Äôll help illuminate the decision space so it feels less overwhelming.‚Äù
